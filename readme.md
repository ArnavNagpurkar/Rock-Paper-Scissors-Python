# Rock Paper Scissors Game Created using Python

## I Suggest you to use the ```main.py``` from the ```Enhanced``` Folder. After reading this markdown, you will know why am I saying this?
#
## Difference Between Both Files
#
### Why to use the Enhanced one?
1. 40 Lines of code reduced.
2. Added the game in Loop so that it can be played, and a function ie. ```playagain()``` removed from the code.
3. New Features Added (Specified further in the markdown)
4. No more ```exit()``` function needed in the game
5. Play the game you will enjoy it more than the ```Normal``` one
#
### Features of the Enhanced One
1. Added the ```gameCount``` variable which helps in so many ways.
2. Improved the "if...else..." Statement of ```stinp```.
3. A variable will store the number of times user played the game which helps further in the code too.
4. More features will be added to the game soon.
#
## If the Enhanced one is way better and fast than the Normal one, Why too use the normal one?
#
# Enjoy the game (prefferably the Enhanced one) and pull requests if any changes can be done to improve the game.
